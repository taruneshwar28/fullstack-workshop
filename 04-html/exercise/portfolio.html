        <li><h3>To Do List</h3></li>
        <p>The To-Do List Application is a simple yet efficient task management system designed to help users organize, track, and manage their daily activities. The application provides an interactive and user-friendly interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while Java is used on the backend to handle data processing, storage, and business logic.

The frontend is built with HTML for structure and CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive layout. JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as adding new tasks, editing existing ones, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks without reloading the page. This enhances user experience through real-time interaction.

The backend, developed using Java, manages task data, handles requests from the frontend, and ensures proper data validation and persistence. Depending on implementation, Java can store tasks in files or a database, allowing users to retain their to-do lists even after closing the application.</p>

        <li><h3>Portfolio</h3></li>
        <p>This project is a personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and professional background. The website features a clean and modern design with a responsive layout that works seamlessly across different devices.

HTML is used to structure the content, CSS handles styling and layout to create an attractive user interface, and JavaScript adds interactivity such as smooth scrolling, dynamic content updates, and user-friendly navigation. The portfolio includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, making it easy for visitors and recruiters to learn more about me and my work.

This project demonstrates my understanding of front-end web development fundamentals, responsive design principles, and the ability to build a professional web presence from scratch.</p>

        <li><h3>Rock Paper Scissor Game</h3></li>
        <p>The Rock Paper Scissors game is a simple yet interactive web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates core front-end development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic.

HTML is used to structure the game layout, including buttons for rock, paper, and scissors, as well as sections to display the player’s choice, the computer’s choice, and the game result. CSS is applied to create an attractive and responsive user interface with clean styling, animations, and visual feedback for user interactions. JavaScript powers the game logic by generating random computer choices, comparing selections, determining the winner, and updating scores dynamically without refreshing the page.

This project is ideal for beginners as it strengthens understanding of JavaScript fundamentals while showcasing how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create an engaging and interactive user experience.</p>
